# RESTful API Assignment:

- This repository contains all standard CRUD operations.

- In addition to the CRUD operations,I also implemented the following search operations:
	a. Find a customer by name
	b. Find customers living in a specific city
	c. Find customers in a specific age group (e.g. age 21 to 30).

-The server will run by default on localhost port 8090, for accessing type : http://localhost:8090/api/customers
-To change the port number you can navigate to Assignment\src\main\application.properties
